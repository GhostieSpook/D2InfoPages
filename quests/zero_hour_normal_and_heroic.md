I'll start off with Credit where it is due: All the solutions and sources used in this post either comes from the RaidSecrets community (Discords/Reddit/users) or clans like Math Class and Redeem. In a few cases, Credit is due to a few users and as much as possible I try to list that, but if I miss someone, I'm sorry and please do tell me so i can edit it in

There will be a lot of information in this post, but I'll structure it so that if you have any questions about a specific thing, you should be able to look it up, instead of reading everything

**What is Zero Hour and What is Outbreak Perfected?**

Zero Hour is the Whisper-stylized hidden quest that appeared on reset the 7th of may 2019, the reward of which is the exotic pulse rifle  [Outbreak Perfected](http://downloads.bungie.net/images/Wallpapers/Outbreak_Prime_Perfected_4K.jpg), an insanely good weapon in PvE with damage scaling the longer it is used on a single target due to it's innate perks: The Corruption Spreads and Parasitism.

The first perk, The Corruption Spreads reads: "Creates SIVA nanite swarms on rapid hits and precision kills" (These nanites act like mini-missiles that first fly out from the target just to fly back at them and attach, doing a small amount of damage each), and Parasitism, the second perk, reads "This weapon does more damage to enemies based on the number of SIVA Nanites that attach to them.

Using this gun alone, it is very strong, but the SIVA Nanites stack with your friends Outbreak Perfected too, which means that it scales insanely the more Outbreak Perfecteds that there are shooting at the same target.

The Guns Catalyst is a reward from completing the mission on Heroic, and requires completions of the mission (and the Configuration puzzle for a faster completion) as well as 500 Headshot kills

**Void/Arc/Solar Configurations**

In the first add-room, there is a exotic quest/Bounty that you can find, It has a duration of 1 minute, meaning you can't keep it and return to orbit, as it will expire and disapeer, but as long as you stay in the mission, the bounty will stay in your inventory. The Bounty is named either Void-, Arc-, or Solar Configuration.

Completing this quest requires 3 Key-cards: Blue, Green, and Red, which can all be found hidden in the heroic version of the mission, as well as "49 SIVA Particulates", which is the main puzzle.

Completing this Bounty gives you the blueprint "Repair Schematics" which will require you to do all 3 elemental configurations to complete, and rewards you with[](https://i.imgur.com/eExYoUb.png)

First, you need to acquire the Configuration and all the keycards, instructions below. They are all in the same positions for all three configurations. The Configurations DO NOT appear if you don't already have the catalyst

**Cryptarch Vault Puzzle - 49 SIVA Particulates**

After getting the keycards, you need to reach the Vault Room and complete the Cryptarch Vault Room Puzzle. But right before that, is an Incinerator room: You need to walk through it the right way (which changes every configuration) to survive.

**How To SIVA Particulates/Cryptarch Vault Puzzle:**

[**see map**](https://i.imgur.com/HrSW5EJ.png)

This shows the Vault room in question, in it you’ve got a couple of things worth looking at:

1.  The three boxes listed 1-2-3 in the main room. These are referred to as the “Consoles”  [(Console 1 outside of green room)](https://i.imgur.com/LD70m4x.png)
    
2.  The colored rooms on the sides, referred to simply by their color: Green, White, Yellow, Red, Purple, Blue, and Cyan  [(Blue room with nodes)](https://i.imgur.com/rXxSzGo.png)
    
3.  Inside each colored room, you have 7 Nodes, see middle of map for their placement and numbering
    

When you have the Void/Arc/Solar Configuration, all of its keycards, and you reach the vault room, you can start the event on one of the three consoles; which will then light up with 2 holographic “Clocks”, and you will be able to  [Lock the nodes](https://imgur.com/NTOU5Y9)

**[Spreadsheet that has all the information you should need, for all three configurations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PJqjJhbvw2mUF70_h-rUq4ImIuA_TXEJxvZP8kGcwEY/edit?usp=sharing)**

[Alternative Spreadsheets](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/bmmj6d/easy_to_read_zero_hour_puzzle_solver/)  (Credit:Math Class, RaidSecrets Discords, and specifically @Hoplite on the discord For creating and filling them out, extra thanks to  [u/Bengat](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bengat/)  for making condensed version, and  [u/P-o-t-a-t-o-e-s-](https://www.reddit.com/u/P-o-t-a-t-o-e-s-/)  for the alternative versions)

Select correct configuration in the bottom of the spreadsheet to find the key to locking

1.  If you look at the consoles you have 2 clocks with 12 segments each, numbered as  [following](https://i.imgur.com/c20IVy5.png).
    
2.  Start your consoles, and they will lock into a  [configuration](https://imgur.com/acYRJCU)
    
3.  look at your clock on one of your consoles in your game, and match the highlighted segment to the clock-image so that you get a number, In this example, it is 7-9 (7 on left clock, 9 on right).
    
4.  match this number to the correct spreadsheet Column, and if there are duplicates on the spreadsheet check another terminal aswell
    
5.  You should now have a single line in the spreadsheet with a node number and location, for us this was Yellow4 (Void Configuration), Activate this Node and it should lock in successfully
    
6.  Repeat 48 times so all 49 nodes are locked in successfully
    

Recommended Terminals:

There are different terminal combinatios for all of the configurations, so there will always be one terminal that is better to primarily check for that configuration due to it having the least amount of duplicates (which means less checking other consoles)

-   For Void Configuration, We recommend checking Terminal 1
    
-   For Arc Configuration, We recommend checking Terminal 2
    
-   For Solar Configuration, We recommend checking Terminal 3
    

Our amazing community has designed several webb apps to help people do the mission without having to read the spreadsheet, see below:

Locking the sequence will either:

A. Fail: the clocks will turn grey  [(and if out of retries, the node will go grey)](https://imgur.com/1pDOwK8).

B. Succeed: the clocks remain  [blue but get a strong yellow backdrop](https://imgur.com/dS19rMQ), and it will flash through 3 different clocks with matching numbers to the right, and  [the glowing node will glow much stronger](https://imgur.com/TT38sxJ)

If you lock a node succesfully, you get +15 seconds on the mission timer

If you fail a node, you can unlock it and try another. You have 9 "Unlocks", and if you fail a node while you still have retries, the main consoles will all go grey and display the amount of retries you still have. If you are out of retries and can't unlock a failed node, the main consoles will instead switch to a new set of clocks each fail.

# Fallen Transponder Code - Information Compulation

(All Credit goes to the Raidsecrets Discord and community, this is simply a collection of what we've found so far)

So, The Fallen Transponder, an exotic quest/bounty found on titan to be used to start the quest Zero Hour, and get Outbreak Perfected, the exotic pulse rifle.

However, there is one more part to it, that isn't really talked about in my earlier megapost, and that is the middle node:

Once all 6 nodes have been found, there appears a middle node, with the title "Rendezvous" (same as the prompt that appears when you find Mithrax to start the quest with), which hoovering over gives the following code:

1((3000)o20)(JS01)((3000b2))(EA3Q)((3000) r20)2((3000)p18)(WJOS)(3000)(1J0E)(3000)( AT3W)(3000)(XW3G)((3000)k18)3((3000)a16 )(JE0A)(3000)(TZOX)(3000)(WJOS)(1J3B)(30 00)(AT3W)(3000)(XW3G)((3000)k16)4((3000 )a14)(JE0A)(3000)(TZOX)(3000)(WJOS)((300 0)a4)(JE3X)(3000)(TZ3U)(3000)(WJ3P)((300 0)a14)5((3000)b12)(EAOT)(3000)(ZXOW)((30 00)b6)(00Q7)((3000)a6)(JE3X)(3000)(TZ3U) ((3000)o12)6((3000)b10)(SI0J)(3000)(EAOT)( (3000)r4)(XWOJ)(S13G)((3000)w4)(ATOZ)(X W3G)((3000)k3)(IJ3B)(3000)(AT3W)((3000)p 10)7((3000)o8)(JS01)(3000)(JE0A)((3000)14)( ZXOW)(JS3F)(JE3X)(3000)(TZ3U)(WJOS)(30 00)(1J0E)(ATOZ)(XW3G)((3000)k3)(1J3B)(300 0)(AT3W)((3000)p8)8((3000)o6)(JS01)(3000) (JE0A)((3000)14)(ZXOW)(005J)(005S)(0051)( 005J)(EA3Q)(ZX3T)(3000)(JS01)(JE0A)(005 T)(005Z)(005X)(005W)(JS3F)((3000)b4)(EA 3Q)(3000)(ZX3T)((3000)b6)9((3000)k4)(1J0 E)(3000)(ATOZ)((3000)p12)(WJOS)(0051)(00 5J)(EA3Q)((3000)r12)(XW3G)(3000)(S13G)((3 000)w4)10((3000)s5)(TZOX)((3000)o32)(JS3 F)((3000)b5)

If we break it up by the numerical numbers outside of brackets, we get:

```
1((3000)o20) (JS0I) ((3000b2)) (EA3Q) ((3000)r20)

2((3000)p18) (WJ0S) (3000) (IJ0E) (3000) (AT3W) (3000) (XW3G) ((3000)k18)

```

----------

Some quick breakdowns regarding the code that we've found:

**1. (3000)**

The number 3000 appears very very often, always in brackets, most of the time within more brackets followed by a letter and a number (ex ((3000)o20). Theese seem to follow a pattern, as the number of the first and last 3000 of each row is the same, and is lowered by 2 for every step, except the last step where it goes up one, from 4 to 5.

**2. XY#Z strings**

In the code, there are several 4 sign long strings that appear in brackets, see them listed below.

Each 4 string that starts with letters (hereby called  **XZ#Y**  strings) follow a certain pattern, that are always a shift of -+3 from the other strings that match the first 2 letters.

Example: AT0Z -> AT3W is a XY(#+3)(Z-3)

All of the 4 sign long strings that start with 005 end on a letter start starts another string, except for A+E

All 4 strings in alphabetical order

-   A - AT0Z, AT3W
    
-   E - EA0T, EA3Q
    
-   I - IJ0E, IJ3B
    
-   J - JE0A, JE3X, JS0I, JS3F
    
-   S - SI0J, SI3G
    
-   T - TZ0X, TZ3U
    
-   W - WJ0S, WJ3P
    
-   X - XW0J, XW3G
    
-   Z - ZX0W, ZX3T
    
-   0 - 00Q7, 005I, 005J, 005S, 005T, 005W, 005X, 005Z
    

**3. Outliers**

There are a few Outliers that has been found:

1.  ((3000b2)) [Line 1] Only one inside 2 immediate brackets
    
2.  [Line 10] only line with the opening # ((3000)X#) one step higher than the one before, standard is 2 steps lower:
    

-   Line 8: ((3000)o6) / ((3000)b6)
    
-   Line 9: ((3000)k4) / ((3000)w4)
    
-   Line 10: ((3000)s5) / (3000)b5)
    

----------

Now to go deeper:

**ASCII Farm:**

The entire code can be used to generate a ASCII art of the logo of  **The Farm**, if you remove all the lettering from the code, and use the following substitions:

```
((3000)#) = # of spaces
0 = /
3 = \
005 = -
007 = X

```

And you will get the following result:

```
                /  \                    
              / / \ \                  
            / / /\ \ \                
          / / /    \ \ \              
        / /      X      \ \            
      / /    /\    /\   \ \          
    / /    /\\ \/ //\   \ \        
  / /    /----\\ //----\    \ \      
/ /            /--\            \ \    
 /                                \

```

**XY#Z Rendezvous**

If we take the numbers in the XY#Z as instructions (#+3 -> Z - 3) on the 005x strings, or possibly the strings they point to (their last letter is the same as most of the XY#Z strings, except those that start with an A or E:

Taking the new last letters of the strings, we can now spell  **Rendezvous**, same name as the middle node, and a recurring thing in this code.

(Credit:  [u/dudface](https://www.reddit.com/u/dudface/),  [u/Bism_](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bism_/), and Raidsecrets Discord)

In addition to this, is that you can arrange the first 2 letters of the XY#Z strings so that the second letter is the same as the first in the next:

`WJ JS SI IJ JE EA AT TZ ZX XW`, and removing all the doublings gives `WJSIJEATZX, which again, is a 5 step cypher away from  **Rendezvous**

(Credit:  [u/echeese](https://www.reddit.com/u/echeese/))

**Rendezvous**

Rendezvous appears over and over again, it's the title of the middle node, it's the prompt when we meet Mithrax at the farm, and it is repeated several several times in the code, such as if you  [remove all brackets and 3000](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/bm4mxk/fallen_transponder_middle_node_code/emzrnet/)  from the code, or  [ceasar-shifting the lowercase letters alone](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/bnm5ue/breakthrough_on_the_fallen_transponder/endm5za/), gives yet again,  **Rendezvous**

What does it all mean? Is it just as simply as "Rendezvous at Farm" or is there more?

----------

This is, to the best of my knowledge, all that has been found so far. If I've missed something, or missed credit where it is due, please let me know so that I can improve the post.

**What we don't know/Haven't solved:**

-   The Outliers have no real explanation to them, other than 007Q, which being unique is needed to make the X in the ASCII art
    
-   If the entire code is some kind of Cypher of it's own, there are discussions that it might be a hex, block-chain, or needs a decyphering key (Possibly Rendezvous)
    
-   After completing the Fallen Transponder, you can click the nodes and they will react by flashing red, clicking the middle node causes node 1 to flash red; We don't know why or if this even matters
    
-   Why does the Fallen Transponder stay in our inventory after we've gotten the weapon? You can discard it, and if you do, you can't pick it up again from where you found it (You get a message about not being interested in it). Could it work like the Awoken Talisman, as in it will have another role to play soon, maybe in the new season?
