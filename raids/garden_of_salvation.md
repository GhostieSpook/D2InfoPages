### Introduction
Welcome to the Vault of Grass!

The Vault of Grass, sometimes called Garden of Salvation, is a new raid that's been added in Shadowkeep. The whole thing is just a glorified wallpaper generator and while the mechanics aren't hard, they are very complex and will require a lot of coordination to get right. Make sure all 6 members of your fireteam have voice comms and are able to properly communicate.

This guide covers all secret chests, but does not cover the steps to get the Divinity. You can find a guide on how to get it here:

Corrections

- Confluxes aren't confluxes, they're relays. Some people also call them "banks" in both of the boss encounters. Whoops.
- Angelicals aren't called Angelicals, they're just Angelics. I played D2 on another language for a while before I switched over to English and never noticed.
- Izanagi's Burden is only better than Whisper of the Worm if you have the catalyst and someone with Lunafaction.
- In the third encounter topic, in the image where I marked the inner an outer eyes for the Consacrated Mind, I marked one wrong: The right one is just from the damage phase, the one from the Overcharges is to the bottom right of it, but you get the idea.
- Tethers seem to prioritize player over signal receptors (plus signs and bosses) most of the time. I didn't know where to include this, so if you see a tether being made and you're not a part of it, stay the hell away!

### Loadouts
If you're new to this game, know that team composition rarely matters. Every class is good enough to do anything on their own and you will likely get at least one of each in a raid, even if you're doing a completely random LFG, so I will be assuming you have at least one of each class and not be touching on that topic much.

Hunter

As a hunter, you have two options. Your first one is to run a top tree (Way Of The Trapper) Nightstalker with Orpheus Rigs. With your invisibility roll and Shadowshot, you can easily clear out ads and safely deposit motes and link tethers whenever needed. You can use The Sixth Coyote for more invisibility on the first two encounters, but you should use Orpheus for the third and fourth so you can shoot the bosses with your Shadowshot and give you entire team a nice damage buff. You should be using this during the first two encounters and you should have at least one hunter using this during the boss encounters.

Your other option is to run a bottom tree Gunslinger (Way Of The Sharpshooter) with Celestial Nighthawk for the third and fourth encounters, assuming there is already another top tree Nightstalker. Your role is quite simple, actually. Great ad clearing with your grenades and throwing knives and 300k - 800k+ damage with your Golden Gun, especially if the boss is tethered with Shadowshot. Celestial is mandatory if you're running this!

Marksman's Dodge so you can quickly reload!

Warlock

Only one choice here, really: Middle tree Dawnblade (Attunement of Grace) with a healing rift and Lunafaction (if you have it). Teammates need healing? Rift. More healing? Nade. Damage phase? Well of Radiance. Simple enough, right? Use your Well during damage phases to give your team a nice boost to survivability and damage.

Titan

Also only one choice here: Top tree Sentinel (Code of the Protector) with Rally Barricade. During ad clearing phases and encounters, you can use your shield to be a good tank and clear out a good portion of ads, and during damage phases, your Ward of Dawn and Rally Barricade will seriously help your team with DPS, just make sure that you're not placing them in a terrible spot!

Optimal General Loadout

Remember that you CAN use anything and A LOT of weapons have as much DPS as you need for the raid, but these are the optimal loadouts for the best versatility and DPS.

Kinetic / Primary

Here you have plenty of choices! Any good weapon with a good roll is good for here, but a kinetic sniper with Firmly Planted is an amazing choice for DPS as well as killing Cyclopses and tough enemies, making it the second best choice for the slot. What's the best, then? Well...
![Izanagi's Burden](/assets/img/izanagis_burden.jpg)

If you have Izanagi's Burden, chambering the 4 shots with all of the aforementioned buffs is the highest DPS in the entire game, so it's an obvious pick for the kinetic slot, especially if you have the catalyst.

Energy / Secondary

Recluse with Overload (First encounter) or Anti-Barrier (Second, third and fourth encounters) rounds, no choice here.
