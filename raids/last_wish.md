## All Wishes for the Wall of Wishes
Hidden at the start of the raid is a small room with 21 buttons, 20 on the wall and one on the ground. By entering the correct pattern and standing on the button, players can make wishes that each have a different reward or effect on the game.

There are sixteen different images that can be cycled through on each of the buttons, starting with four fish symbols, then four snake symbols, four dragon symbols, and then four bird symbols.

* Wishes can be made as a solo player
* Players can input as many wishes as they want, however…
* Players are unable to “restart” the raid if they use a teleport wish
* Wishes can be used to teleport to later bosses without having to defeat any other boss (teleporting to Morgeth skips Kalli and Shuro Chi)
* Using the fourth wish to skip to Shuro Chi allows players to backtrack to the secret chest and collect it

More wishes are still being found by the Destiny 2 community. A large effort is taking place over on [RaidSecrets,](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/) go and join in on the conversation. This guide will continue to be updated as additional wishes are found.
